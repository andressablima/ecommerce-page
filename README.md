# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce product page solution

This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). I always try to make it in my own way, not exactly as the challenge asks.

## Overview
That's my solution to the challenge, I did the cart in a different way, also the slider section, with a different way to show the products pictures. The cart I put in a way that it looks cleaner and simple.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site with different screen sizes, such as 1440px/768px/425px.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch the large product image by hovering on the small thumbnail images
- View the cart and prices

### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use the slider component in the products section with all the images and thumbnails, as well as design a cart section showing picture, description and prices. It was very challenging to do this, I intend to improve more and more in my JS skills so I can improve the cart section and the part where user add and remove products.

### Continued development

I will keep focusing on my JS skills so I can improve add and remove to the cart part.
